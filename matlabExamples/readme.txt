By popular demand, here are two MATLAB scripts that reproduce Fig. 1d (letter reconstructions) and Fig. 1e (tSNE plot and k-NN classification). See "tsneAndKNNExample.m" for tSNE plot and k-NN classifier, and "handwritingReconstructionExample.m" for handwriting reconstructions. "gaussSmooth_fast.m" and "tsneWarpDist.m" are helper functions that should be on the MATLAB code path. To run these, you'll have to replace the file loading paths at the top of the scripts to point to the relevant file paths on your computer.
